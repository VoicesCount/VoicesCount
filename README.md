Welcome!

With growing advancements in technology and communication, it's more important than ever to understand how language develops - and where gaps still exist, especially among lesser-spoken languages.

This account collects and shares insights from surveys focused on language development across diverse communities. Our goal is to highlight patterns, challenges, and unique voices that are often underrepresented.

Whether you're a parent, educator, student, or researcher, we invite you to follow along, explore the data, and be part of the effort to make every language count.
